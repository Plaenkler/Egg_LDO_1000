## ðŸ“– About the EGG LDO 1000

The EGG LDO 1000 is an expansion of the modular EGG design series, representing a larger model within the portfolio. The EGG series consists of a variety of modules that can be used independently and are based on different PCB designs.
Unlike the LDO 250, the LDO 1000 is designed to handle higher current applications, offering a linear voltage regulator capable of delivering up to 1000 mA.
In this model, the XC6220B331MR-G voltage regulator is utilized, providing a stable output of 3.3V and supporting a load of up to 1000 mA.
This makes it significantly more suitable for higher power requirements compared to the LDO 250.
It also features overcurrent protection and thermal shutdown for enhanced safety.
